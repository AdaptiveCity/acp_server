Author: Ian Lewis - ijl20@cam.ac.uk

This repository is for the the "tfc_server" system, containing:

* Realtime vehicle position feed handlers

* Zone analyzers, i.e. modules that detect vehicles entering/leaving geographic zones

* Consoles, for reporting the status of the various modules

* HTTP servers that present the user interface and consoles.

The system uses Java / Vertx to be event driven throughout
